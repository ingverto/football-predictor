# Football Match Predictor (XGBoost + Elo)

This project predicts the outcome of international football matches (`win`, `loss`, `draw`) using machine learning. It combines a custom Elo rating system, form tracking based on recent goal differences, and an XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter optimization.

## Features

- Encoded categorical features for teams and tournaments
- Elo rating calculation for each team
- Team form based on last 5 matches' goal difference
- Elo difference (`elo_diff`) as a feature
- XGBoost classifier with GridSearchCV for optimal parameters
- Class balancing using computed sample weights
- Confusion matrix and feature importance visualization
- Exports all trained trees to `xgb_trees.pdf`

## Dataset

This dataset includes 47,960 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2024. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches.

### Files

- `results.csv`: All historical match results  
- `shootouts.csv`: Matches with penalty shootouts  
- `goalscorers.csv`: Goal details per player  

> Note: Matches are strictly menâ€™s full internationals and exclude Olympic Games and youth/B-team matches.
