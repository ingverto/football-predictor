# World Cup Match Predictor (XGBoost + Elo)

This project simulates an entire international football tournament using machine learning. It combines a trained XGBoost classifier with Elo ratings and recent team form to predict match outcomes. The simulator includes both group stages and knockout rounds, just like a real FIFA World Cup.

## Features

- Select 32 national teams and assign them to groups Aâ€“H
- Predict match outcomes using a trained AI model
- Use Elo ratings and recent goal difference as features
- Simulate group stages and knockout brackets
- Predict penalty shootouts using a separate model
- Display group tables, match summaries, and final winners

## How to run


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost joblib
python main_gui.py
